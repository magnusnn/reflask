A simple demo app combining React + webpack and Flask.

The application consists of a single page which continually takes a photo through the users camera every second, before sending it to the backend for classification with the ResNet50 model in Keras. The results are not always correct (though often amusing), but the application is meant to serve as a simple example of combining Flask with React and webpack.

## Requirements

The requirements for the application are as follows:

* Node.js
* Python 64-bit version between 3.5.x and 3.8.x.

The specific python version requirements is due to the use of [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).

## Getting started

To setup the environment and required dependencies for both frontend and backend, run the following commands.

**From folder ```/backend```:**
``` 
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will create a virtual environment for our python backend, and install all the dependencies defined in requirements.txt.

*If you're using the Windows Command Shell or PowerShell, activate the virtual environment by running the command ```venv\Scripts\activate``` in your shell.*

**From folder ```/frontend```:**
```
npm install
```
This will install all the frontend dependencies defined in package.json.

If everthing is successful, go ahead and start the project by running the following commands in their own separate terminal windows:

**From folder ```/frontend```:**
```
npm run start
npm run start:server
```
Make sure you have the virtual environent activated in the terminal used to start the backend.

The app should now be running on http://localhost:5000.

## Running in production mode

When running the app in production mode Flask will function as a regular web server, serving the static html and javascript files to the client.
For the sake of simplicity, there is a command to build a production bundle from webpack and start the backend to serve it as if in production mode.

As before, be sure to have your virtual environment activated when running the below command.
```
npm run start:prod
```
The app should then be accessible on http://localhost:5000, now serving the production bundle.

## Tech stack

The application makes use of the following libraries.

**Backend (Python)**
- Flask
- TensorFlow / Keras
- python-livereload

**Frontend (JavaScript)**
- React
- webpack
- webpack-dev-server

### Additional notes

Everything in the app is served from Flask, both in development and production mode. However, in order to enable hot reloading in the frontend during development, an instance of webpack-dev-server is running under the hood. By employing a reverse proxy, we direct any requests for static files to the webpack-dev-server during development.

The application uses the package [cross-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-env) to simplify use of environment variables across platforms.*
